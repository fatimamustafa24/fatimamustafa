Understanding Modulus and Division in Python 
In Python, the division operator (/) returns the quotient of a division operation, including decimal 
points for non-integer results. For example, 10 / 3 results in 3.3333333333333335 because 10 
divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder, and the decimal part represents the fractional remainder.

result = 10/3
